# E-commerce App TDD Workshop

Welcome to the Test-Driven Development workshop for building a professional e-commerce application with Vue 3, Pinia, and CSS!

## Overview

This workshop is designed to teach junior engineers how to build a production-ready e-commerce application using TDD principles. You'll progress through a series of challenges, each with corresponding tests. Your goal is to write code that satisfies all the tests.

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Pinia for state management
- Vitest for testing
- CSS for styling (no external UI libraries)

## Workshop Structure

Each module contains:

1. A markdown file with instructions and requirements
2. A corresponding test file that validates your implementation
3. Mock data when needed

### Modules:

1. **Product Catalog** - Display products with filtering and sorting
2. **Shopping Cart** - Add, remove, and update products in cart
3. **User Authentication** - Login and registration
4. **Checkout Process** - Multi-step checkout flow
5. **Order Management** - View and manage orders
6. **Product Details** - Detailed product view with image gallery

## How to Use This Workshop

1. Start with Module 1 and read the instructions in the markdown file
2. Run the tests to see what is expected (they will fail initially)
3. Write code to make the tests pass
4. Move to the next module once all tests are passing

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests for a specific module
npm run test:module1

# Run all tests
npm run test
```

Good luck and happy coding!
